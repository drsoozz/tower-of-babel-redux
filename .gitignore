# ============================
# 1. Virtual Environment Files
# ============================

# Ignore the virtual environment folder (common name: venv)
# These folders contain 3rd-party packages and are often large,
# machine-specific, and unnecessary to track in Git.
venv/

# ============================
# 2. Python Bytecode Caches
# ============================

# Ignore Python's cache folders and compiled bytecode
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
# These are auto-generated to speed up execution and don't need to be in version control.

# ============================
# 3. Build and Distribution Files
# ============================

# Ignore output folders from PyInstaller and similar tools
build/
dist/
# These are generated every time you build your project and can be re-created at any time.

# If you want to **keep your game’s .exe**, comment out the next line:
# *.exe

# Optional: Keep only your game's .exe, ignore the rest
# !dist/mygame.exe

# ============================
# 4. IDE and Editor Settings
# ============================

# VS Code extension file (like VSCodeCounter)
.VSCodeCounter
# Common VSCode settings folders
.vscode/
# JetBrains IDEs (like PyCharm)
.idea/

# ============================
# 5. Game Saves or Temp Files
# ============================

# Ignore saved game files
*.sav
# You may want to track save files elsewhere if doing backups, but they usually don’t belong in Git.

# ============================
# 6. OS-Generated Files
# ============================

# macOS
.DS_Store
# Windows
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini
